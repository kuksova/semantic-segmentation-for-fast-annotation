# semantic-segmentation-for-fast-annotation

The project aims to simplify the automatic annotation process of indoor and outdoor images by fine-tuning a general segmentation model to pre-selected popular objects (e.g. sky, floor, tree, etc). 

This approach limits a variety of classes to be considered and therefore significantly reduces complexity of delivered segmentation masks.
